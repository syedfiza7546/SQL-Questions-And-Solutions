# SQL-Questions-And-Solutions

**Overview:**

This collection is a quiet chronicle of my journey into SQL over a short span of time. The questions and solutions gathered here are drawn from various sources—videos, practice platforms like LeetCode, exchanges with ChatGPT, and other scattered corners. Within these pages, you’ll find a patchwork of problems I’ve wrestled with, paired with sample data and their expected outcomes. It’s not a declaration of mastery, but rather a modest record of effort—an honest attempt to learn, solve, and understand.

**Contents:**
- SQL queries with solutions
- Sample data 
- Expected outputs and results

This is a personal record of my SQL learning experience.
